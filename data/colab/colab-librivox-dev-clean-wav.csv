/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0007.wav,137936,even in middle age they were still comely and the old grey haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity not to say majesty of their own
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0008.wav,49054,the men were as handsome as the women beautiful
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0009.wav,181755,i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that is best in egyptian greek and italian
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0010.wav,135181,the children were infinite in number and exceedingly merry i need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty

/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0012.wav,139113,the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering

/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0014.wav,281034,in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something but i gathered no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0015.wav,188058,suffice it that i found myself taken before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first i had seen looking anything but well and handsome

/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0017.wav,120370,the other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0018.wav,198656,they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and said something in a tone quite pleasant as though i were all right
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0019.wav,127487,but by and by they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0020.wav,139207,again there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of rust and decay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0021.wav,105653,we passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0022.wav,62082,the design was different but the thing was clearly the same
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0023.wav,43050,this had some effect in calming him
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0024.wav,69304,he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kinder manner

/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0001.wav,57650,this is a mistake though a perfectly natural one
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0002.wav,116498,on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revises to the printer
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0003.wav,161337,then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one another
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0004.wav,156645,i regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwin's theory to an absurdity
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0005.wav,238003,i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer neither shall i mention the name of the book here though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0006.wav,198734,but this had an effect of which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to call them life long self deceivers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter

/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0011.wav,175335,i attribute its unlooked for success mainly to two early favourable reviews the first in the pall mall gazette of april twelfth and the second in the spectator of april twentieth

/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0014.wav,214535,i made a few further very trifling alterations before moulds were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy two as new editions were from time to time wanted they have been printed from stereos then made
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0015.wav,189914,i am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of erewhon that were repeatedly rewritten but from those that had only a single writing i would gladly cut out some forty or fifty pages if i could

/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/3536-8226-0018.wav,165843,but trevelyan was of a different opinion and he was disgusted and revolted most unreasonably by the appearance of his minister's domestic arrangements
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/3536-8226-0019.wav,97133,bozzle had always waited upon him with a decent coat and a well brushed hat and clean shoes
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/3536-8226-0020.wav,119350,it is very much easier for such men as mister bozzle to carry decency of appearance about with them than to keep it at home
/content/data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/3536-8226-0021.wav,89083,perhaps you could put on your coat and walk out with me for a few minutes said trevelyan
