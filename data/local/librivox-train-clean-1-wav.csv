/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0014.wav,281034,in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something but i gathered no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0015.wav,188058,suffice it that i found myself taken before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first i had seen looking anything but well and handsome
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0016.wav,147337,in fact one of them was plainly very much out of health and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it

/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0018.wav,198656,they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and said something in a tone quite pleasant as though i were all right
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0019.wav,127487,but by and by they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0020.wav,139207,again there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of rust and decay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0021.wav,105653,we passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0022.wav,62082,the design was different but the thing was clearly the same
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0023.wav,43050,this had some effect in calming him
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153954-0024.wav,69304,he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kinder manner

/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0004.wav,156645,i regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwin's theory to an absurdity
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0005.wav,238003,i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer neither shall i mention the name of the book here though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0006.wav,198734,but this had an effect of which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to call them life long self deceivers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0007.wav,155517,i must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures

/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2412-153947-0010.wav,295408,i see from my second preface that i took the book to messrs chapman and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who has attained the highest rank among living writers i let it sleep till i took it to mister trubner early in eighteen seventy two

/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0009.wav,116598,while the danger had not lessened it had not as yet materialised and with him no news was good news
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0010.wav,100570,so little did he consider drouet that it never once occurred to him to worry about his finding out
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0011.wav,87399,he grew restless as he ruminated and then decided that perhaps it was nothing
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0012.wav,52463,she had not been able to get away this morning

/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0014.wav,82132,after a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the madison car

/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0019.wav,71975,but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0020.wav,102395,then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing contemplating the result of his work
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0021.wav,65073,what would she do about that the confounded wretch
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0022.wav,70220,later however his old discretion asserted itself
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0023.wav,79960,something had to be done a climax was near and she would not sit idle

/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0025.wav,69042,he arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0026.wav,95629,the long drizzle had begun pedestrians had turned up collars and trousers at the bottom

/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0028.wav,60327,he put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0029.wav,51095,he would have some arrangement of this thing
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0030.wav,118313,he began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other that he had sent the money perhaps he could do it up here
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0031.wav,67600,he would go in and see anyhow he would have no row
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0032.wav,199967,by the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself that he could see his way out
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0033.wav,51468,then he rang the bell no answer
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2277-149896-0034.wav,71183,he rang again this time harder still no answer
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2428-83699-0000.wav,227664,i imagine there were several kinds of old fashioned christmases but it could hardly be worse than a chop in my chambers or horror of horrors at the club or my cousin lucy's notion of what she calls the festive season
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2428-83699-0001.wav,38661,festive yes

/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2428-83699-0003.wav,110692,it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2428-83699-0004.wav,39108,the whole thing was a trifle odd
/Users/gabriel.t.nishimura/projects/masters/ctc/data_dir/LibriSpeech/dev-clean-new/2428-83699-0005.wav,161802,there was nothing said about the sort of accommodation which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the table which was kept
